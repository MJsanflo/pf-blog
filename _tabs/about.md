# Welcome To My Learning Blog!

### Justifying This Blog's Existance

Practice in learning and embracing the role of the most-naïve-in-the-room when exposed to new topics has worked best for me to keep my interest and motivation alive. Therefore, I decided to create this blog, where I will be posting questions that arise as I navigate my learning path. Through these, I will conduct independent research, explore mathematical concepts, and engage in technical experiments to find the best answers or intuitive explanations.

If the content inspiring the question comes from lectures at the University of Hamburg, I will reach out to my university’s research groups for guidance and post their insights if permitted. Posts will be marked with the prefix '[WIP]' until all questions motivating the post are addressed. Otherwise, expect updates and revisions.

This blog will also serve as a portfolio, allowing potential collaborators to see how I approach new topics, formulate questions, and work through my thought processes.

Expect posts on topics such as Classical Machine Learning, Mathematics for Machine Learning, Introductory Deep Learning, Mathematical Convex Optimization, and general math. If you are interested in any of these topics, would like to provide advice, contribute to existing posts, or notice that I have missed proper crediting or referencing, please reach out through the contact forms provided. I am open to everything and happy to collaborate.

### The Person Behind These Posts

In 2023, after two years with my employer, and despite greatly appreciating them, I made the bold decision to step away from my Data Engineer role. I realized that while my duties were valuable for the company, they were no longer fully fulfilling me intellectually.

Before this, in 2016, I graduated with a Bachelor's in Computer Systems Engineering and continued after to work for about five years in North American and German companies as a Database Engineer and Data Analyst/Engineer, respectively.

Motivated to leave my former focus behind, with an open mind and a desire to explore new areas of interest and fresh challenges, I enrolled in an Informatics master’s program at the University of Hamburg, Germany. After my first semester, it became clear to me that my newly discovered interest lies in applied mathematics and its related fields, particularly Machine Learning and Optimization. While this master’s program provided the exposure I needed to discover these interests and shape my understanding, I realized there was work to be done—specifically, catching up on the fundamental mathematics I either forgot after more than eight years away from university or didn’t fully grasp in the first place. This effort is aimed at building a strong foundation to fairly pursue these new interests.

Cheers!
